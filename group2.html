  <div id="answer1" class="collapse">
  Structured programming is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and
development time of a computer program by making extensive use of the structured control flow
constructs of selection (if/then/else) and repetition (while and for), block structures, and
subroutines. Control Structures are just a way to specify flow of control in programs. Any algorithm or program can be clearer and more understood if they use self-contained modules called as logic or control structures. It basically analyses and chooses in which direction a program flows based on certain parameters or conditions. There are three basic types of logic, or flow of control, known as:
<br>
1. Sequence logic, or sequential flow
<br>
2. Selection logic, or conditional flow
<br>
3. Iteration logic, or repetitive flow
